# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## DESCRIPTION 

Designed by Kerehama, This interview chatbot is designed to simulate a job interview experience. It guides users through various stages of a mock interview, starting with initial questions, proceeding to follow-up questions, and culminating in constructive feedback on their performance. The chatbot uses Google's Gemini AI to generate natural and relevant interview questions and responses, making the experience dynamic and interactive. It keeps track of the conversation history and the current interview stage to ensure a coherent and structured interview process.
